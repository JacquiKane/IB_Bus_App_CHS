<!-- 6.1 SL/HL Paper 1 Preparation Highlights -->
<h4><p>SL/HL Paper 1 Preparation Guidance</p></h4>
<p> A useful way to begin is to re-read the<span id="id_pre_released_statement" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">pre-released statement</a></span>. While defining terms which are not in the<span id="id_business_management_g" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Business Management Guide.</a></span></p>
<p> It would be sensible to also research some organizations that are already operating in the industry or market that is the focus of the pre-released statement.</p>
<p> A <span id="id_swot_analysis" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">SWOT</a></span>or<span id="id_steeple_analysis" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">STEEPLE analysis</a></span> of these organizations could be a really good starting point into understanding the pre-released statement for Paper 1.  </p>

<p> The final examinations answers must be in context to the case-study paper and industry or market that it focuses  on. </p>
<p> It is extremely important that there should be no prepared answers and your responses must be applied to the business in the<span id="id_stimulus_material" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">stimulus material</a></span> </p>
<!-- 6.1 SL/HL Paper 2 Preparation Highlights -->
<h4><p style="text-align: center;"> For Paper 2</p></h4>
<p>Students will receive an examination booklet where they can read the questions, and will write their answers to multiple sets of questions based on short case studies and stimulus material. </p>
<p> Section A of Paper 2 will contain three quantitative questions which will all require a short answer. Section B questions will asses qualitative skills of the student. Like explanations and discussions regarding the case-study.</p>
<p> For both sections the questions will be subdivided into parts. These parts will cover<span id="id_a01" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">A01</a></span> ,<span id="id_a02" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">A02</a></span>,<span id="id_a03" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">A03</a></span>and<span id="id_a04" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">A04</a></span></p>

<!-- 6.1 Information about A01,A02,A03,A04 questions on Paper 1 and 2 -->

<h4><p> A01,A02,A03,A04 Question Information</p></h4>
<p> Assessment Objective questions carry the highest marks. They are more difficult because they require the student to have knowledge of<span id="id_business_contnet" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">business content</a></span>and<span id="id_business_application" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">business application</a></span> related to the business within the case study.</p>
<p> One-Sided answers will not score high marks if there is no counter arguments. For an argument to score highly there needs to be arguments in favor and against.</p>
<p>Similarly answers that are<span id="id_not_substantiated" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">not substantiated</a></span> will loose marks.</p>
<p>Break even questions are extremely popular for both SL and HL. This is especially true for Paper 2 Section A</p>
<p> For A04 questions it is important to show all of your work, especially for the calculate questions. Even if the final answer is incorrect the student can still receive partial marks for showing the work associated with the question.</p>

        <h4>  <p>Standard Deviation</p>   </h4>
        <p>Standard Deviation is a measure of dispersion or how close variables are grouped together around a mean value. Variables with a low Standard Deviation are closely tied to the mean. A set of variables with a high Standard Deviation imply that the values are not closely tied to the mean and have wide variability.</p>
