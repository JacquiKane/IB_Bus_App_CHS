      <h3>5.1 Introduction to operations management</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_operations_management">Operations management</a> plays a pivotal role in the
        functioning of businesses, serving as the
        engine behind transforming inputs into valuable outputs that generate
        revenue. It encompasses decisions and actions aimed at efficiently
        managing resources, processes, and systems to ensure the smooth flow
        of operations. One aspect involves deciding whether to handle
        operations internally or outsource them, balancing factors like
        control and expertise. Moreover, operations management intertwines
        with sustainability efforts, responding to stakeholder demands for
        transparency and responsible resource use. This includes adopting
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_circular_economy">circular economy</a>
        and business models, which focus on reducing waste and promoting
        environmental sustainability. Successful examples like Ikea and
        Starbucks demonstrate the efficacy of integrating sustainability into
        operations. Thus, the role of operations management extends beyond
        mere production; it entails steering businesses towards profitability,
        efficiency, and environmental responsibility in a cohesive manner.

      <h3>5.2 Operations Methods</h3>
      <p>
        In determining the most appropriate production method for an
        organization, several factors must be considered.<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_jobProduction">Job
          production</a>
        is often favored for niche markets with specific customer
        requirements, as it allows for the creation of unique products
        tailored to individual specifications. Conversely,
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_batchProduction">Batch Production</a>
        offers flexibility and customization within consignments, making it
        suitable for larger production runs that require some degree of
        variation.<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_flowProduction">Flow production</a>
        is best suited for high-volume standard products with limited variety,
        while<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_massCustomization">Mass customization</a>
        combines mass production with flexibility to offer personalized
        products on a large scale. The choice of method ultimately depends on
        market characteristics such as size and demand predictability. For
        instance, flow production and mass customization are cost-effective
        options for markets with large and predictable sales, while job
        production and batch production cater to smaller, niche markets and
        allow for customization. However, implementing these methods requires
        considerations such as coordination, monitoring, technological
        investment, and alignment with information systems. The selected
        method impacts factors like economies of scale, HR management, and
        technology integration, influencing the organization's overall
        efficiency and competitiveness. Therefore, the most appropriate method
        is determined by a careful assessment of market dynamics and
        production needs, ensuring alignment with the organization's goals and
        objectives.

      <h3>5.3 Lean production and quality management (HL only)</h3>
      <p>
        Less waste and greater efficiency in production refer to minimizing
        unnecessary resources and activities, enhancing productivity, and
        reducing costs. Lean production, a method aimed at achieving these
        goals, involves strategies like just-in-time (JIT) production and
        cradle-to-cradle design, focusing on sustainability and resource
        optimization.
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityControl">Quality control</a>
        and
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityAssurance">quality assurance</a>
        are vital aspects of lean production and
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_totalQualityManagement">total quality management (TQM)</a>, ensuring
        consistent product quality. Methods such as
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_qualityCircles">quality circles</a>
        and
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_benchmarking">benchmarking</a> aid
        in managing quality effectively, fostering employee empowerment and
        continuous improvement. Implementing lean production and TQM
        profoundly impacts organizational culture, structure, and leadership,
        emphasizing collaboration and customer satisfaction. Adhering to
        national and international quality standards, like ISO 9001,
        reinforces product quality and builds trust with customers. In
        summary, integrating lean production and quality management enhances
        efficiency, reduces waste, maintains high-quality standards, and
        fosters
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_continuousImprovement">continuous improvement (Kaizen)</a>
        within organizations.

      <h3>5.4 Location</h3>
      <p>
        The selection of a production location is influenced by various
        factors, including cost, proximity to resources, and market access.
        Companies may opt for<a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_outsourcing">outsourcing</a>
        or
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_subcontracting">subcontracting</a> to
        leverage external expertise or lower labor costs.
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_offshoring">Offshoring</a> involves
        relocating production to another country to benefit from lower labor
        costs or access to new markets. Conversely,
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_reshoring">reshoring</a> refers to
        bringing production back to the home country, often due to rising
        costs or quality concerns associated with offshoring.
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_inshoring">Inshoring</a> involves
        internalizing production processes to maintain control over quality
        and intellectual property. Reorganizing production nationally or
        internationally requires careful consideration of factors such as
        labor laws, infrastructure, and supply chain efficiency to optimize
        cost-effectiveness and competitiveness.

    <div class="infoCard">
      <h3>5.6 Production planning (HL Only)</h3>
      <p>
        Organizations strive to make the most efficient use of their stock of
        raw materials, finished products and fixed capital. Production
        planning is concerned with how raw materials are used, and it is
        important to have sufficient quantities to ensure the smooth running
        of the production process. The
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_localSupplyChain">local supply chain</a>
        is the full production and distribution process in close proximity to
        an organization. The
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_globalSupplyChain">global supply chain</a>
        contains more intermediaries between the primary producer and the
        final consumer, extending over a range of countries. The supply chain
        process highlights all the intermediaries involved in the production
        process, from the primary producer through to the customer.
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_labourProductivity">Labour productivity</a>,
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_capitalProductivity">capital productivity</a>, and
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_productionRate">production rate</a>
        are all used to highlight the productivity rates of an organization.
        Some production planning decisions include whether to buy in or make
        components or finished products. The decision to buy in or make is a
        complex one and show not merely be reduced to cost savings. There are
        many additional factors to consider, which are both qualitative and
        quantitative.

      <h3>5.7 Crisis Management and contingency planning (HL only)</h3>
      <p>
        Crisis management manages a crisis after it has occurred in real time,
        without having undertaken sufficient long-term strategic planning.
        Contingency Planning allows for the fact that a crisis could occur
        under different scenarios and tries to plan accordingly. The three
        factors that affect crisis management are speed, transparency, and
        control & communication. Contingency planning is always a risk as the
        event may never happen. Significant resources can be committed to
        contingency planning without a return. The challenge for organizations
        is can they take that risk?

      <h3>5.8 Research and Development (HL only)</h3>
      <p>
        Successful Research and Development can lead to increased revenue and
        market share. It could also include new production methods, customer
        service programmes, innovative ways of structuring or financing an
        organization, achieving new levels of quality assurance and further
        opportunities for cost reduction and/or productivity gains. An
        organization’s survival may depend on its capacity for
        <a href="#" class="keyterm" id="id_innovation">innovation</a>. We live
        in an era of new products and services that on first viewing may not
        have been considered valuable or even perceived as a need. Innovations
        like the motor car, streaming sites like iTunes, or plant-based meat
        products. For competitive reasons especially, creating new needs is of
        paramount importance even if initial consumer confusion is evident.
        R&D, invention, and risk taking by an entrepreneur requires some form
        of legal protection because thought would discourage even more R&D if
        they could not see the profits of their labor. Things like privacy and
        copyright infringement could threaten the economic stability of a
        whole industry. Incremental innovation is a series of small
        improvements made to a product or service. An example would be the
        iPhone with a new model that comes out every year. Disruptive
        innovation is when an innovation alerts stakeholders behavior and they
        are reluctant to return to traditional methods of carrying out an
        activity. An example of this is with Amazon's e-commerce tactics that
        forced other companies to adapt.
