            <h3>1.2 Private vs Public:</h3>
            <p><b>Public companies</b> are entities that have sold a portion of themselves to the public via an initial public offering (IPO), meaning their shares are traded on stock exchanges and they must disclose business and financial activities to the public.</p>
            <p><b>Private companies</b> are owned by their founders, management, or a group of private investors, and do not trade their shares on public markets. They are not required to disclose detailed information publicly and have more flexibility in their operations.</p>

            <h3>Social Enterprise:</h3>
            <p>A social enterprise is a business that prioritizes social objectives as its main goal. It operates with a commercial mindset to maximize societal and environmental benefits, reinvesting profits into social programs rather than distributing them to shareholders.</p>

            <h3>Cooperatives:</h3>
            <p>A cooperative is a private, member-owned business organization that's controlled by the people who use its products, supplies, or services. Cooperatives are formed voluntarily to meet members' common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.</p>

            <h3>NGO's:</h3>
            <p>An NGO, or non-governmental organization, is a nonprofit group operating independently of government, dedicated to addressing social, environmental, or political issues. NGOs often focus on humanitarian activities, advocacy, and community development.</p>

        <p>Guiding questions</p>
        <li>What are <span class="keyTerm" id="id_economies_of_scale"><a href="#">economies of scale</a></span>, both internal and external, and <span class="keyTerm" id="id_diseconomies_of_scale"><a href="#">diseconomies of scale</a></span>?</li>
        <li>What is the difference between internal and external growth?</li>
        <li>Why do some organizations grow, and what is the most appropriate way for a business to grow externally?</li>
        <li>Why do some organizations remain small?</li>

        <h3></b>Economies of scale (A02)</b></h3>
        <p><b>Chapter Summary:</b> This unit emphasizes the pivotal role of change across all chapters. As organizations expand, they tap into economies of scale, lowering long-term production costs. These economies can be internal <span class="keyTerm" id="id_firm_growth"><a href="#">firm growth</a></span> or external <span class="keyTerm" id="id_industry_expansion"><a href="#">industry expansion</a></span>. While giants like telecoms and car manufacturers enjoy vast economies of scale, small firms face hurdles in competing due to limited resources and market share.</p>

        <a href="#" class="keyTerm" id="id_pool_of_labor">Pool of available labour grows as industry expands</a>
        <p><b>Financial:</b> Increased collateral and lenders' confidence reduce finance costs. This falls under internal factors.</p>
        <p><b>Purchasing:</b> Bulk purchasing enables the acquisition of raw materials at lower costs. (Internal)</p>
        <p><b>Risk-bearing:</b> Large corporations can take the risk of venturing into new markets and funding prototypes of products, with uncertain outcomes.</p>
        <p><b>Marketing:</b> Advertising using media with very large customer reach (eg television) lowers unit costs dramatically.(External)</p>
        <p><b>Research and development:</b> As an industry grows, firms can share research facilities, reducing the costs of new product development.(External)</p>
        <p><b>Pool of available labour grows as industry expands:</b> As an industry grows, local labour migrates to other areas and people gain skills through work experience and/or attending training colleges.(External)</p>


        <h3></b>Diseconomies of scale (A02)</b></h3>
        <p>Large firms can face <span class="keyTerm" id="id_diseconomies_of_scale"><a href="#">diseconomies of scale</a></span>, Long-run unit costs may rise due to management challenges with organizational growth, causing communication issues, demotivation, and quality concerns among staff. Multinational firms might also face difficulties coordinating supply chains across regions, elevating expenses.</p>

        <h3></b>The difference between internal and external growth (A02)</b></h3>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_internal_growth"><a href="#"></a><b>Internal growth:</b></span> Organizations achieve internal growth, or organic growth, by selling more existing products to expand market share. It offers control over expansion, especially valued by private and family-owned businesses.</p>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_external_growth"><a href="#"></a><b>External growth:</b></span> An organization can also try to grow externally, which is often referred to as external growth. Methods of external growth include:


        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_joint_ventures"><a href="#">Joint ventures</a></span></p>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_strategic_alliances"><a href="#">Strategic alliances</a></span></p>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_takeovers"><a href="#">Takeovers</a></span></p>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_franchising"><a href="#">Franchising</a></span></p>
        <p><span class="keyTerm" id="id_mergers"><a href="#">Mergers and acquisitions</a></span></p>

        <h3></b>Reasons some organizations grow, and external growth methods (A03)</b></h3>
        <p>Organizations aim to grow due to various reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Larger size provides greater financial resilience against external changes, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
            <li>Growth allows for taking bigger risks with potential for higher rewards, fostering innovation.</li>
            <li>Increased growth and profitability attract investors and capital, leading to further success.</li>
            <li>However, concerns about management control, communication challenges, and overconfidence among industry leaders have emerged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3></b>External growth methods Joint ventures and strategic alliances:</b></h3>
        <p>External growth methods such as joint ventures and strategic alliances involve collaboration between firms to achieve mutual benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_joint_ventures"><a href="#">Joint Ventures:</a></span> Agreements between two or more firms to share risks, capital, and expertise in a project, typically within the same industry. Joint ventures facilitate shared resources and knowledge.</li>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_strategic_alliances"><a href="#">Strategic Alliances:</a></span> Similar to joint ventures but less formal, with no transfer of ownership. These alliances still allow firms to collaborate on projects or ventures without establishing a separate entity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example is entering a foreign market: a firm may form a joint venture or strategic alliance with a local company to leverage their market knowledge or labor resources. This partnership can lead to cost and time savings and help avoid costly mistakes.</p>
        <p>For more detailed insights into international market entry challenges and opportunities, refer to chapter 4.6.</p>

        <h3></b>Mergers and acquisitions and takeovers:</b></h3>
        <p>Some textbooks confuse mergers and acquisitions (M&As) with takeovers, but they differ in mutual agreement. Takeovers can be hostile, like Nestlé's acquisition of Rowntree against protests. Three main types of M&As exist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_horizontal"><a href="#">Horizontal:</a></span> acquiring a rival for market share and economies of scale.</li>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_vertical"><a href="#">Vertical:</a></span>acquiring a business in the supply chain for control.</li>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_conglomerate"><a href="#">Conglomerate:</a></span> acquiring unrelated businesses to avoid R&D costs, but risky due to management challenges. Some mergers fail due to culture clashes, diseconomies of scale, and CEO hubris.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3></b>Franchising:</b></h3>
        <p>Franchising: Franchisor sells business idea to franchisee. McDonald's, in "The Founder," showcases success through global expansion via franchising.</p>


        <h3></b>IB Learner Profile:</b></h3>
        <p>Franchising, exemplified by McDonald's, showcases diverse models. Exploring a different franchise in your country can enrich business research. Benefits include shared brand recognition, established business systems, and mutual growth opportunities.</p>


        <h3></b>Benefits to the Franchisor and Benefits to the Franchisee:</b></h3>
        <span class="keyTerm" id="id_ene">Benefits to the Franchisor:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased brand awareness over larger areas at minimal cost.</li>
            <li>Royalties with minimal risk after initial payment.</li>
            <li>Motivated franchisees committed to business model.</li>
        </ul>


        <span class="keyTerm" id="id_ene">Benefits to the Franchisee:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Run a business with established brand, reducing start-up costs.</li>
            <li>Receive training, equipment, and expertise from franchisor.</li>
            <li>Potential economies of scale if supplied with materials.</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="keyTerm" id="id_cha">Challenges:</span>

        <ul>
            <li>Flexibility in franchise agreements varies, affecting growth opportunities.</li>
            <li>Clustering and cannibalization can occur, impacting franchisee competition.</li>
            <li>Standardization may limit entrepreneurial creativity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Question for reflection:</strong></p>
        <p>Has the franchise growth model increased the chances for economic sustainability at the expense of creativity? </p>

        <h3>Revision checklist:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The chapter discusses reasons for organizational growth, focusing on internal and external economies of scale for cost advantages.</li>
            <li>External growth strategies include franchising, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and mergers/acquisitions.</li>
            <li>Some organizations prefer staying small to avoid diseconomies of scale, target niche markets, or maintain control, notably family-owned companies like Lego, Illy, and Ferrari.</li>

        <h3>1.6 Multinational Companies</h3>
        <p>How can we evaluate the impact of multinational corporations (<span class="keyTerm" id="id_mnc"><a href="#">MNCs</a></span>) on the host countries?</p>
        <p>Multinational corporations (MNCs) operate and control resources outside their home country, often outsourcing production processes. Notable examples include <span class="keyTerm" id="id_ikea"><a href="#">Ikea</a></span>, <span class="keyTerm" id="id_subway"><a href="#">Subway</a></span>, and <span class="keyTerm" id="id_apple"><a href="#">Apple</a></span>. While MNCs like Costco, Ikea, and Walmart are welcomed by stakeholders like potential employees and consumers, they also face criticism for job displacement and impacts on local businesses.</p>

        <h3>The Impact of Multinational Companies on the Host Country (A03)</h3>
        <p>MNCs bring benefits such as job creation, revenue for host governments, technology transfer, and increased choice of goods and services. However, they also pose challenges such as unfair competition for local producers and potential tax avoidance practices. Perspectives on their impact vary, with some emphasizing economic benefits and others highlighting ethical concerns.</p>

        <p>MNCs often operate across different sectors of the economy, including the <span class="keyTerm" id="id_primary_sector"><a href="#">primary sector</a></span>, which involves activities related to natural resources extraction and agriculture.</p>

        <h3>Examples of Ireland and Singapore</h3>
        <p>The Irish economy was transformed by encouraging <span class="keyTerm" id="id_mnc"><a href="#">multinational corporation (MNC)</a></span> activity, leading to mixed results. Singapore's economic rise was also fueled by collaboration with <span class="keyTerm" id="id_mnc"><a href="#">MNCs</a></span> in various sectors, resulting in impressive growth and local business development. Recent investigations reveal that some <span class="keyTerm" id="id_primarysector"><a href="#">multinational corporations (MNCs)</a></span> legally avoid paying taxes in the countries they operate in, opting for jurisdictions with more favorable tax laws. While journals like The Economist credit <span class="keyTerm" id="id_mnc"><a href="#">MNCs</a></span> for driving economic wealth, their influence has faced challenges from pressure groups and other stakeholders. Your perspective determines which view is more persuasive.</p>

        <h3>Revision Checklist</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_pos">Positive Impact of MNC Activity:</a></span> Theoretically, MNC activity in a host country tends to have positive effects, including creating employment opportunities, introducing new technology, and attracting capital investment.</li>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_cha">Challenges for Local Competitors:</a></span> Local competitors may struggle with MNC activity, as it can lead to increased wages to compete for talent.</li>
            <li><span class="keyTerm" id="id_ethical_concerns"><a href="#">Ethical Concerns:</a></span> MNCs face scrutiny over tax practices, as they employ legal tax avoidance strategies and shift profits globally, potentially reducing their tax contributions to host countries.</li>
