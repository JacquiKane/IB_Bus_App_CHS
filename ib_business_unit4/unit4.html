      <h3>4.1 Introduction to Marketing</h3>
      <p>Marketing is the process of planning, executing, and analyzing strategies to promote products, services, or
        ideas to specific audiences. It involves understanding customer behavior, market trends, and competition to
        create effective plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marketing encompasses activities like research, product development, branding,
        advertising, sales, and customer relations. Its aim is to generate awareness, interest, desire, and action,
        leading to customer acquisition, retention, and loyalty. In the digital age, marketing has evolved to use
        platforms like social media, email, search engines, and content to reach and engage audiences more effectively.
      </p>






      <p>
        Organizations with high market share inevitably become <span id="id_marketleader" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">market leaders</a></span>. Increasing market share and becoming a market leader can be an important aim, but it comes with
        problems. Being a market leader may attract the interest of governments and regulatory bodies determined to stop
        organizations from abusing their power.

    <div class="infoCard">
      <h3>4.2 Marketing planning</h3>
      <p>Market segmentation is the process of classifying customers with similar needs and wants within a whole market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customers may be classified based on their age, gender, location, lifestyle, and occupation. Once this
        classification has taken place, a business can determine a <span id="id_targetmarket" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">target market</a></span>.</p>



      <p><span id="id_nichemarket" class="keyTerm">
        <a href="#">Niche markets</a></span> target
        specific segments, while a <span id="id_massmarket" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">mass market </a></span> aims broadly.
        Organizations may transition from niche to mass markets.</p>
      <p></p>
      Niche markets rely on smaller sales volumes with higher prices, while mass marketing requires larger budgets.
      </p>




      <p>Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) differentiate products,
        influencing consumer perception and pricing strategies.</p>

      <h3>4.3: Sales Forecasting</h3>


        <p>
          The focus is on introducing simple linear regression analysis as a tool for creating sales forecasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method involves collecting market research data, typically done by specialized outside companies
          skilled in data mining and analytics.
        </p>


        <ul>
          <li><span id="id_positiverelationship" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">Positive relationship</a></span></li>
          <br>
          <li><span id="id_negativerelationship" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">Negative relationship</a></span></li><br>
          <li><span id="id_norelationship" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">No relationship</a></span></li>
          <br>
          <li>Simple linear regression analysis is introduced as a method to address this complexity and create
            forecasts by analyzing the relationship..<p>
          </li>

          </p>
        </ul>


        <p>
          Once market research data has been collected and presented on a scatter diagram, the organization will want a
          <span id="id_lineofbestfit" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">line of best fit</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p> The line of best fit indicates the <span id="id_trend" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">trend</a></span> of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to create a range of
          <span id="id_extrapolation" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">extrapolations</a></span> leading to a range of forecasts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also note that some organizations operate in markets which are 
            <span id="id_seasonal" class="keyTerm">
                <a href="#">seasonal</a></span>.
        </p>
        <p>Over a much longer period, other variations in camping equipment sales may be experienced. This is called <span id="id_cyclicalvariations" class="keyTerm">
                <a href="#">cyclical variations</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Economies have <span id="id_recession" class="keyTerm">
                <a href="#">recessions</a></span> and <span id="id_recovery" class="keyTerm">
                    <a href="#">recoveries</a></span>.</p>

      <h3>4.4 Market Research</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>Surveys - surveys might gather feedback from customers directly via the internet, through online surveys.
        </li>
        <li>Focus Groups - interviews can have the drawback that some respondents may feel intimated by one-on-one
          approach</li>
        <li>Interviews - tend to be more in-depth than surveys but with fewer respondents.</li>
        <li>Observation - if location is an important consideration for a new business start-up it can be used to know
          stuff about the people traffic.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>The internet has provided a range of opportunities to find research from organizations. The real problem is
        finding accurate market analysis surveys that are suited to an organizations needs.</p>

      <p>Media and newspaper articles provide another starting point for secondary research. It is important for a
        market researcher conducting secondary research into a range of topics, markets, opinions and trends.</p>


      <p>
        <span id="id_qualitativeresearch" class="keyTerm">
            <a href="#">Qualitative research</a></span> can be obtained from consumers
        taking part in group discussions such as focus groups, or in-depth interviews.
      </p>
      <span id="id_quanitativeresearch" class="keyTerm">
        <a href="#">Quantitative research</a></span> is conducted mostly through
      pre-prepared questions.
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>Sampling is a process where an organization will investigate a group of segment of customers to learn both
        qualitative and quantitative information.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Random: there is an equal chance that any respondent will be chosen for the sample.</li>
        <li>Quota: Respondents are segmented into groups that share characteristics. The interviewer is the given a
          target sample.</li>
        <li>Convenience: This is a quick, non-random method for low budgets.</li>
